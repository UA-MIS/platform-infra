# platform-infra — Capstone IDP

Single source of truth for the cluster. ArgoCD watches this repo and reconciles
everything in it. This is the **platform-engineer-owned** half of the platform
(students own their app repos).

## Local dev cluster (k3d) — prerequisites

> The rest of this README covers the **local k3d inner-loop cluster** for developing
> platform changes on your workstation. For the **production Talos cluster**, see the
> [Operator Guide](docs/operator/README.md) — you do not run `make cluster-up` there
> (Talos is provisioned out-of-band; ArgoCD is pointed at it via
> `make bootstrap TARGET=real-talos KUBE_CONTEXT=admin@capstone`).

| Tool | Why | Install |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `k3d` ≥ v5.9 | creates the k3s-in-Docker cluster (D-002) | release binary -> `~/.local/bin` |
| `kubectl` | talk to the cluster | distro pkg |
| `docker` **or** rootless `podman` | container runtime k3d drives | distro pkg |
| `helm`, `kubeseal` | later tasks (T3/T4) | distro pkg / release binary |

### Container runtime: Docker vs rootless Podman

The Makefile auto-detects the runtime. With **rootless Podman** it points k3d at
your user socket (`/run/user/$UID/podman/podman.sock`) and bind-mounts that
socket into the k3d nodes, avoiding the root-owned `/var/run/docker.sock`.

> **Rootless Podman requires one host prerequisite:** the cgroup-v2 **`cpuset`**
> controller must be delegated to your user, or k3s won't start
> (`failed to find cpuset cgroup (v2)`). `make preflight` checks this and prints
> the fix. One-time, needs root, then log out/in (or reboot):
>
> ```bash
> sudo mkdir -p /etc/systemd/system/user@.service.d
> printf '[Service]\nDelegate=cpu cpuset io memory pids\n' | \
>   sudo tee /etc/systemd/system/user@.service.d/delegate.conf
> sudo systemctl daemon-reload
> loginctl terminate-user "$(id -un)"   # or reboot
> ```
>
> Verify after: `cat /sys/fs/cgroup/user.slice/user-$(id -u).slice/user@$(id -u).service/cgroup.controllers`
> must list `cpuset`. (Native Docker / Docker Desktop users can ignore this.)

## Quick start

```bash
cd platform-infra

make preflight       # verify tools + cpuset delegation (actionable errors)
make cluster-up      # create the k3d cluster if absent (idempotent)
make cluster-info    # nodes + registry + ingress base URL
# ... later phases:
make bootstrap       # (T3) apply ArgoCD root app-of-apps
make bootstrap-reapply  # re-apply install-owned bootstrap objects after a bootstrap/ merge
make seal SECRET=... # (T4) kubeseal a secret for git
make cluster-stop    # stop the cluster + registry without deleting
make cluster-start   # restart a STOPPED cluster + registry (post-reboot)
make cluster-down    # tear the cluster down (idempotent)
```

All targets are **idempotent** — re-running them never errors. `cluster-up`
creates the cluster only if missing (otherwise starts it); `cluster-down` is a
no-op when the cluster is already gone.

### Post-reboot recovery (`cluster-start`)

A host reboot leaves the k3d cluster and registry **containers stopped, not
deleted** — so you don't need `cluster-up` (which would try to recreate them).
`make cluster-start` brings the existing cluster back in one command:

```bash
make cluster-start   # starts the registry, then the cluster, waits for nodes Ready
```

It injects the rootless-Podman socket automatically (no manual
`DOCKER_HOST=…` export), starts the registry **before** the cluster so node
containerd can resolve it, `k3d cluster start`s the cluster, waits for nodes to
go `Ready`, and switches your kube-context to `k3d-$(CLUSTER_NAME)`. ArgoCD apps
may take a minute to re-settle to `Healthy` after the restart. The inverse,
`make cluster-stop`, stops both without deleting them.

### Re-applying install-owned bootstrap objects (`bootstrap-reapply`)

**Most of the platform is GitOps-reconciled** — ArgoCD watches this repo and
self-heals `platform-services/`, `tenants/`, `applicationsets/`. But two objects
are **install-owned and NOT GitOps-reconciled, by design**:

- `bootstrap/argocd-install/` — the upstream ArgoCD install plus our `argocd-server`
  patches (the `server.insecure` flag, the UI-theme CSS volume mount).
- `bootstrap/platform-appproject.yaml` — the `platform` AppProject (its
  `sourceRepos` allowlist, destinations, resource whitelists).

These are the chicken-and-egg roots ArgoCD's own apps live in and run on, so the
application-controller doesn't manage them — `make bootstrap` applies them once.
**Consequence:** when you merge a PR that changes anything under `bootstrap/`, git
is updated but the **live cluster stays stale** until you re-apply. (We hit this:
the Harbor chart blocked on a missing `sourceRepos` entry, and the UI theme 404'd
because the `argocd-server` volume mount never reached the live Deployment.)

After merging any `bootstrap/` change, run:

```bash
make bootstrap-reapply
```

It server-side-applies (with `--force-conflicts`) both objects, then rolls
`argocd-server` so any Deployment-spec change (e.g. a new volume mount) takes
effect. **Idempotent** — safe to run repeatedly; a no-op when the live objects
already match git (the rollout creates no new ReplicaSet if the spec is unchanged).
It does **not** modify the manifests or touch GitOps-synced services.

> **argocd-cm is co-managed — `bootstrap-reapply` actively prevents an SSO/theme
> outage.** `argocd-cm` is layered: the install ships only the
> `resource.customizations.*` keys, while the GitOps `platform-svc-argocd-config` app
> owns the `ui.*` (theme/banner) and `oidc.*` (SSO) keys. **Verified live (2026-06-16):
> a standalone `kubectl apply -k bootstrap/argocd-install --server-side
> --force-conflicts` WIPED the entire `argocd-cm.data` — `oidc.config`, `url`, all
> `ui.*` gone, SSO login broke — and the GitOps app did NOT self-heal.** Cause: the
> live `argocd-cm` carried a stale `kubectl.kubernetes.io/last-applied-configuration`
> annotation listing the `ui.*`/`oidc.*` keys; the `--force-conflicts` CSA→SSA
> migration prunes any last-applied field absent from the applied manifest. `make
> bootstrap` only survives this because the GitOps app applies the ui/oidc keys
> *after* the install apply — a standalone re-apply has no such follow-up. So
> `bootstrap-reapply` (1) **strips the stale annotation first** (removes the trigger),
> (2) re-applies the install + AppProject, (3) **force-syncs `platform-svc-argocd-config`
> to re-assert the ui/oidc keys — a hard refresh / passive selfHeal is NOT enough,
> only a force-sync restores them — BEFORE (4) it rolls `argocd-server` (so the server
> re-reads the restored `oidc.config`), then (5) asserts `oidc.config` AND `ui.cssurl`
> are present, failing loudly otherwise.** The one-time annotation strip on its own:
>
> ```bash
> kubectl -n argocd annotate cm argocd-cm kubectl.kubernetes.io/last-applied-configuration-
> ```

### Built-in registry (D-005)

`cluster-up` provisions `k3d-registry.localhost:5000` and ensures it resolves on
the host. The local CI loop (T8) builds and pushes images there; containerd on
every node is pre-wired to pull from it. To push from the host you need a hosts
entry (the Makefile adds it if `/etc/hosts` is writable, otherwise prints):

```bash
echo '127.0.0.1 k3d-registry.localhost' | sudo tee -a /etc/hosts
```

## Portability (§6)

Switch targets with `TARGET=`:

```bash
make cluster-up TARGET=local-k3d     # local dev cluster (default)
# real-talos is provisioned out-of-band (talhelper); ArgoCD is pointed at it — no
# cluster-up. Land the platform with:
#   make bootstrap TARGET=real-talos KUBE_CONTEXT=admin@capstone
```

Only three variables differ between targets — `PLATFORM_DOMAIN`, `REGISTRY`,
`GITHUB_ORG` — all in `clusters/<target>/values.env`. Everything else (tenants,
AppProjects, ApplicationSets, quotas, RBAC, NetworkPolicies) is identical across
targets because it is written against those variables, not hardcoded. The live
production target is **`real-talos`** (`clusters/real-talos/`); `real-k3s` is a
superseded stub that redirects to it.
